**Todosh** is a comprehensive and user-friendly shopping list app that helps users keep track of their shopping needs. With the ability to add items to your list, Todosh makes it easy to keep track of all the items you need to purchase. The app also has a feature that allows you to mark items as complete, making it simple to see what items you've already purchased and what's still left on your list.

One of the key features of Todosh is its auto-suggestion feature, which provides suggestions based on items you have already completed. This feature not only saves time by reducing the need to manually type in each item, but it also helps avoid duplicating items on your list. The auto-suggestion feature is powered by the app's ability to learn from your previous shopping trips, making it more intelligent and tailored to your needs over time.

Todosh is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy to add, complete, and manage items on your shopping list. Whether you're a busy professional, a student, or a stay-at-home parent, Todosh is the perfect tool to help you keep your shopping organized and efficient. Try Todosh today and experience the difference for yourself!
