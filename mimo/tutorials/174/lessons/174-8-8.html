Conversely, in order to stop, the <strong>condition</strong> must become <code><span class="literal">false</span></code>.</p><code><span class="keyword">int</span> i = <span class="number">1</span>;<br /><span class="keyword">while</span> (i &gt; <span class="number">0</span>)<br />{<br /> Console.Write(i + <span class="string">"; "</span>);<br /> i++;<br />}<br /><output><item>1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; ...</item></output></code><p visible-if="correct">See that? <code>i</code> starts at <code><span class="number">1</span></code> and increments in every iteration, so it'll always be greater than <code><span class="number">0</span></code>. We've created something we shouldn't have: an <strong>infinite loop</strong>.</p><p visible-if="correct">Psst: if that happens, we might have to close the whole program in order to get out of it.</p></body></html>
