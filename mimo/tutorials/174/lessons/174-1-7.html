In fact, he's defeating so many that it's hard to keep count.</p><p>Use type inference to create a <code>plansDefeated</code> variable. Start at <code><span class="number">0</span></code>, add <code><span class="number">5</span></code>, and another <code><span class="number">1</span></code>. Finally, display a summary in the console.</p><code visible-if="correct"><span class="keyword">var</span> plansDefeated = <span class="number">0</span>;<br />plansDefeated += <span class="number">5</span>;<br />plansDefeated++;<br />Console.WriteLine(<span class="string">"Agent Smith defeated "</span> + plansDefeated + <span class="string">" plans"</span>);<br /><output><item>Agent Smith defeated 6 plans</item></output></code><p visible-if="correct">Nice! We can save the count in an <code><span class="keyword">int</span></code>-type variable and use the <code>++</code> code to increment the count.</p></body></html>
