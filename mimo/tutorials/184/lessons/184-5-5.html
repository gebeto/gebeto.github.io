Just like with arrays, we can access a character as if it's an element. Strings are also <strong>zero-indexed</strong>, so we can access the third letter using <code>[<span class="number">2</span>]</code>.</p><p visible-if="wrong">Whoops. Is how we would access the third element in an array?</p></body></html>
