<!DOCTYPE html ><html><body><p>So we can convert numbers to strings, but what about converting <strong>strings to numbers</strong>?</p><p>Well, Ruby does that too! But there's a <strong>catch</strong>. Can you figure it out?</p><code>string = <span class="string">"</span><selection id="selection-1"><item value="1" correct="true"><span class="number">5</span></item><item value="2" correct="false">five</item></selection><span class="string">"</span><br />print string.to_i <output><item for="1">5</item><item for="2">0</item></output></code><p visible-if="correct">Boom! The <code>to_i</code> method converts strings to <strong>integers</strong>. However, when it doesn't recognize any numbers in the string, it'll produce a <code><span class="number">0</span></code>.</p><p visible-if="wrong">Uh .. that's not really what we were going for, is it?</p></body></html>
