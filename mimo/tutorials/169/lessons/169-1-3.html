<!DOCTYPE html ><html><body><p>Muta-whatily? In Ruby, <strong>strings</strong> are <strong>mutable</strong>, which means they can change as needed. Give this a go:</p><code>storage = <span class="string">"I keep my tools in "</span><br />container = <span class="string">"</span><selection id="selection-1"><item value="1" correct="true">my pockets</item><item value="2" correct="true">my socks</item></selection><span class="string">" </span><br />storage = storage + container<br />print storage<br /><output><item for="1">I keep my tools in my pockets</item><item for="2">I keep my tools in my socks</item></output></code><p visible-if="correct">You do? Well, you do you. Ruby does its thing and combines strings when we ask it to, but it can only combine the same <strong>types</strong> of data.</p><p visible-if="correct">Psst: this will also work with single quotes.</p></body></html>
