We've just added a so-called <strong>key-value pair</strong> to <code>hash</code> and asked Ruby to display the value that belongs to its key, <code><span class="string">"name"</span></code>.</p><p visible-if="correct">Psst: while we <em>can</em> use <code>=&amp;gt;</code>, which to assign a value to a key, that's not the only way to get there.</p></body></html>
